# Prime-Prework-Week-3-Assignment
Prime prework assignment practicing variables, conditional statements, functions, and scope

## Getting Started 
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
1. Download .zip file
2. View .js files

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript

## Instructions I Was Given

This week we introduced the programming language of the Internet, JavaScript. With JavaScript we can make our websites smart by adding interactivity and logic.

## Topics Covered
* The prompt function and user input
* Creating a variable
* Conditional statement
* Functions
* Scope

## Assignment

As always, start off by forking and cloning this repository from GitHub. Open the code up in Atom to get started.

Don't forget to keep the existing code as is and ignore any code that is commented: `// -- DON'T TOUCH CODE BELOW --`. Also, remember `console.log()` is your friend and you can use it in conjunction with the browser console to see the output of your code as you go.

### Files Provided

This week you'll be completing the scripts in the following files. But note, that we have different levels of difficulty contained within each file.

- [ ] *1_alert.js* (Base)
- [ ] *2_types.js* (Base)
- [ ] *3_scope.js* (Pro)

Each script has some code ready for you with comments telling you what to write. For example, a
sample assignment file might have originally been assigned like this:

```javascript
function tripleThis( number ){
  // this function accepts a number as an argument
  // write code that triples the number given
  // return this new, higher number
} // end tripleThis
```

After doing your work, it might look something like the following:

```javascript
function tripleThis( number ){
  // this function accepts a number as an argument
  // write code that triples the number given
  var answer = number * 3;
  // return this new, higher number
  return answer;
} // end tripleThis
```
#### Modes

Above, we introduced the concept of levels of difficulty. "Mode" is how we will typically refer to each level. Below is a brief explanation of

* what to expect when attempting each mode
* if they are required or not

Mode | Description
--- | ---
Base | required
Hard | optional, stretches your understanding
Pro | optional, stretches your understanding and may require additional research

**NOTE:** All the *.js* files are already sourced into *index.html*.

**IMPORTANT:** Don't edit or worry about any files other than the *.js* files.

### Assignment Submission
Check in your repo, then turn in your work via the Prime Academy Assignment Application at http://primeacademy.io, as usual and don't hesitate to hit up the Slack channel as needed!
